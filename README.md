Hotkeyed scoreboard for streamers, with a nice green background for chroma keying in OBS or XSplit.
Windows only, might port it to Linux some other day.

**HOW TO USE**

First, place a font of your choice in the executable folder, and rename it "font.ttf". I use [Big Noodle Titling](https://www.dafont.com/bignoodletitling.font), but it should take any TrueType font.

F1 increases wins, F2 increases losses, F3 increases draws. Holding ALT and pressing a key decreases its corresponding value.
